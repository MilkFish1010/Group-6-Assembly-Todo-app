4. VIEWING AND FILTERING
================================================================================

THREE VIEW MODES:

ALL TASKS (Default)
- Shows every task in your list
- Both completed and incomplete tasks visible
- Best for: Getting the full picture of all your work

TODAY/UPCOMING
- Shows only incomplete tasks
- Hides completed tasks
- Best for: Focusing on what still needs to be done

COMPLETED
- Shows only completed tasks
- Hides incomplete tasks
- Best for: Reviewing finished work, archive view

SWITCHING VIEWS:
- Click the appropriate button at the top of the task list:
  * "All Tasks"
  * "Today/Upcoming"
  * "Completed"
- The list updates immediately
- Task details panel still works in any view

================================================================================
5. SEARCHING FOR TASKS
================================================================================

USING THE SEARCH BOX:

Step 1: Type in the Search Box
- Click in the search box at the top right
- Start typing any part of a task title or description
- The list filters in real-time as you type

Step 2: View Results
- Only matching tasks are displayed
- Search is case-insensitive (finds "TEST" and "test")
- Searches both title and description fields

Step 3: Clear the Search
- Click the "Clear" button next to the search box
- All tasks reappear based on your current view mode

SEARCH TIPS:
- Search works in combination with view filters
- Try searching in "Today/Upcoming" view to find specific incomplete tasks
- Partial words work (searching "gro" finds "groceries")

6. SAVING AND LOADING
================================================================================

SAVING YOUR TASK LIST:

Step 1: Click "Save List"
- A file dialog window will open

Step 2: Choose Location and Name
- Navigate to where you want to save
- Enter a filename (example: "my_tasks")
- The .todo extension is added automatically

Step 3: Confirm
- Click "Save" in the dialog
- A confirmation message appears when successful

LOADING A TASK LIST:

Step 1: Click "Load List"
- A file dialog window will open

Step 2: Select a File
- Navigate to your saved .todo file
- Click on the file to select it

Step 3: Open
- Click "Open" in the dialog
- Your tasks load immediately
- Previous tasks are replaced with the loaded file

FILE FORMAT:
- Files use the .todo extension
- Binary format ensures data integrity
- Compatible across different computers
- You can share .todo files with other users

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Loading a file REPLACES your current task list
- Always save before loading if you have unsaved changes
- .todo files preserve all task information:

  * Priority levels
  * Due dates
  * Completion status

8. TIPS AND BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

ORGANIZING YOUR TASKS:
1. Use priority levels consistently
   - High (⬆): Due today or critical
   - Medium (➡): Important but not urgent
   - Low (⬇): When you have time

2. Write descriptive titles
   - Good: "Submit project proposal"
   - Less helpful: "Do thing"

3. Use descriptions for details
   - Add context, requirements, or notes
   - Include relevant information you might forget

4. Set realistic due dates
   - Use MM/DD/YYYY format (e.g., 12/31/2025)
   - Leave undated for ongoing tasks

WORKFLOW SUGGESTIONS:
1. Start your day in "Today/Upcoming" view
2. Mark tasks complete as you finish them
3. Use search to find specific tasks quickly
4. Save your list regularly (daily or weekly)
5. Review "Completed" view to track progress

FILE MANAGEMENT:
1. Create dated backups (e.g., "tasks_2025_11_13.todo")
2. Keep important lists in a dedicated folder
3. Share .todo files with team members if needed

MAXIMUM CAPACITY:
- The application can store up to 100 tasks
- If you reach this limit, consider archiving completed tasks
- Save old tasks to a backup file, then delete them from the active list

9. TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

PROBLEM: "Can't add task - no error message appears"
SOLUTION: Make sure you've entered a task title. The title field is required.

PROBLEM: "Task list is empty after loading a file"
SOLUTION: The file might be empty or corrupted. Try loading a different file.

PROBLEM: "Buttons don't respond to clicks"
SOLUTION: Make sure a task is selected (for Edit/Delete/Mark Complete).
          Only "Add Task", "Save", and "Load" work without selection.

PROBLEM: "Window controls overlap or look strange"
SOLUTION: Your window might be too small. Resize it larger. The application
          enforces minimum dimensions to prevent layout issues.

PROBLEM: "Search doesn't find my task"
SOLUTION: Check your spelling and remember search is case-insensitive.
          Make sure you're in the right view mode (All Tasks shows everything).

PROBLEM: "My changes disappeared"
SOLUTION: Changes are not saved automatically. Always click "Save List"
          before closing the application or loading a different file.

PROBLEM: "Application won't start"
SOLUTION: Ensure you have:
          - Windows operating system
          - The .exe file is not corrupted
          - Sufficient permissions to run programs

RESETTING THE APPLICATION:
- Simply close and restart the program
- Your last saved file is preserved
- To start fresh, create a new empty list and save it
